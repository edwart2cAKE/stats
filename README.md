## Stratified Sampling and Email List Generation

This creates a file <code>email_list.txt</code> that has the emails that you send to.

<code>email_list.txt</code> will have each email list separated by a line of dashes. Each email list will have at most 75 emails to prevent getting flagged by spam filters.
